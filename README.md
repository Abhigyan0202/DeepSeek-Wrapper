Created a web-based chat interface integrated with DeepSeek AI through a custom-built wrapper.
The frontend is developed using React, whereas the backend employs Express.js.
Interface communication between the frontend and backend is achieved through the Fetch API, allowing for smooth real-time interaction with DeepSeek's language model.
The project showcases full-stack integration and API interaction for conversational AI interface development.
